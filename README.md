# Assignment Task for Data Scientists

## Introduction
You are a Data Scientist working at upday, a news aggregator and recommender.

The engineering team at upday is gathering on a regular basis articles from all the Web. In order to provide a proper filtering functionality in the app, the articles need to be categorized.

You have at your disposal a pre-labelled dataset that maps different articles and their metadata to a specific category.

It's up to you now to help the company providing a solution for automatically categorizing articles.

## Assignment

The repository contains a dataset with some english articles and some information about them:

* category
* title
* text
* url

The purpose of the task is to provide a classification model for the articles.

## Instructions

You should make a pull request to this repository containing the solution. If you need to clarify any point of your solution, please include an explanation in the PR description.

What we expect:

* Results from your data exploration and an explanation about the solution you adopted.
* Documentation of the results of your model, including the choice of model(s), metrics adopted and the final evaluation.
* The training and evaluation code, ideally a separate script.

The solution should just perform better than random, also we expect you to use a model that is not just rules-based.

How to present the documentation and the code is up to you, whether to provide python scripts, jupyter notebooks or via a different mean. 


## Bonus

Show off your engineering skills. What steps would you take to productionize this model? 

We have listed some ideas below, but we would love to see the steps you would take. 
* Wrap your model into an API and document your instructions on how to test it
* Or.. Create a Docker image (or surprise us!) that can be used to run your code
* Or.. Include some unit tests in your training code
